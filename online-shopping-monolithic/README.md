# Grocery_Online_Shopping_App
This repository features an Online Grocery Shopping Application using ES6 in a Monolithic way. The application is later segregated in Microservices Architecture, so each individual service will work independently to serve the purpose and business logic. The Microservices approah can be seen here [Online Shopping App Microservice Architecture](https://github.com/eliasonic/online_shopping_microservice).
